Thank you for sending over the feature request. Before we proceed, I have a few questions to ensure that all requirements and scenarios are addressed:

1. How will the system handle cases where an employee has received a positive result for COVID-19 multiple times?
2. Are there any restrictions on the format or size of the photos that can be uploaded?
3. Can you provide more details on how the group isolation feature will work? For example, how will the system determine which employees were in close contact with an infected individual?
4. Are there any specific technologies or frameworks that we need to use for the server-side implementation?
5. How will the system handle cases where an employee has received a vaccine from a manufacturer that is not currently supported by the system?
